Since, reducing the amount of emotional content, whether positive or negative, increased the number of posts with the opposite emotion, and vice-versa, I think the better approach to this experiment that would maintain data privacy is through machine learning. If our machine learning model sees that there are more negative than positive posts at a within a given timeframe (say the past 10 days), we could then analyze the future posts in a given time window (say the next 5 days) to see how having more negative posts on the newsfeed for the past 10 days affected the emotion of the posts that people made in the given time window.
